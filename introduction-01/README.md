### **Module 1: Introduction to Monorepos ‚Äì Detailed Outline**  

#### **1.1 What is a Monorepo?**  
- Definition of a monorepo  
- How it differs from a traditional multi-repository approach  
- Common misconceptions about monorepos  

#### **1.2 Differences Between Monorepos and Polyrepos**  
- **Code organization:** Single vs. multiple repositories  
- **Dependency management:** Shared vs. isolated dependencies  
- **Collaboration:** Easier cross-team collaboration vs. independent teams  
- **CI/CD workflows:** Shared pipelines vs. separate workflows  
- **Versioning strategies:** Single versioning vs. independent versions  

#### **1.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Monorepos**  
##### **‚úÖ Advantages:**  
- Code sharing and reusability  
- Simplified dependency management  
- Easier refactoring across multiple projects  
- Unified build and CI/CD processes  
- Better visibility and collaboration  

##### **‚ùå Disadvantages:**  
- Increased complexity for large teams  
- Tooling challenges (scaling Git, handling build times)  
- Permissions management can be tricky  
- Potential for unnecessary coupling between projects  

#### **1.4 Real-World Examples of Monorepos**  
- **Google:** Uses a single massive monorepo with Bazel  
- **Facebook:** Monorepo powered by Mercurial and Buck  
- **Microsoft:** Manages core projects in a monorepo  
- **Uber, Airbnb, and Twitter:** How they structure their monorepos

### **Definition of a Monorepo**  
A **monorepo (monolithic repository)** is a single version-controlled code repository that contains multiple projects, applications, or libraries. Instead of splitting projects into separate repositories (polyrepo approach), everything is stored in one centralized repository.

**Key Characteristics of a Monorepo:**  
- A single repository for multiple projects  
- Shared dependencies and code across projects  
- Unified build, testing, and deployment workflows  
- A single source of truth for collaboration

### **How a Monorepo Differs from a Traditional Multi-Repository Approach (Polyrepo)**  

| Feature          | **Monorepo**                                      | **Polyrepo (Multi-Repo)**                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Repository Structure** | One repository for all projects | Separate repositories for each project |
| **Dependency Management** | Shared dependencies across projects | Independent dependencies per repo |
| **Code Sharing** | Easy to share code and utilities | Requires publishing shared packages |
| **Collaboration** | All teams work in one repo with a unified workflow | Teams work independently with separate workflows |
| **CI/CD** | Single CI/CD setup for all projects | Separate CI/CD for each repo |
| **Scaling** | Can become complex in large organizations | Easier to scale with isolated projects |

### **Common Misconceptions About Monorepos**  

1. **‚ÄúMonorepo means a monolithic application‚Äù**  
   - ‚ùå **Wrong!** Monorepos can contain microservices, libraries, and independent projects. It‚Äôs about repository structure, not architecture.  

2. **‚ÄúMonorepos slow down Git and development‚Äù**  
   - ‚úÖ This can happen for **huge** repositories, but tools like **Nx, Turborepo, and Bazel** optimize builds and workflows.  

3. **‚ÄúMonorepos make deployment harder‚Äù**  
   - ‚úÖ If set up correctly, monorepos **simplify CI/CD**, ensuring consistent builds and releases.  

4. **‚ÄúMonorepos force every team to work on the same thing‚Äù**  
   - ‚ùå Teams can still have **isolated** workflows with proper permissions and branch strategies.
