Let's start with an outline for your monorepo learning journey:

### **Monorepo Course Outline**
#### **Module 1: Introduction to Monorepos**
- What is a monorepo?
- Differences between monorepos and polyrepos
- Advantages and disadvantages of monorepos
- Real-world examples (Google, Facebook, Microsoft)

#### **Module 2: Setting Up a Basic Monorepo**
- Choosing a monorepo tool (Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, Lerna)
- Setting up a monorepo with Nx (or your preferred tool)
- Managing multiple packages in a single repository
- Version control best practices for monorepos (Git, GitHub Actions)

#### **Module 3: Package and Dependency Management**
- Using `pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn` workspaces
- Dependency hoisting and linking
- Managing internal and external dependencies
- Publishing packages from a monorepo

#### **Module 4: Build and CI/CD Automation**
- Optimizing builds in monorepos (Turborepo, Nx, Bazel)
- Configuring CI/CD pipelines for monorepos (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD)
- Incremental builds and caching
- Automated testing in monorepos (Jest, Cypress, Playwright)

#### **Module 5: Advanced Monorepo Strategies**
- Code sharing and reusability
- Microservices vs. monorepos
- Security best practices
- Scaling monorepos in large teams

#### **Module 6: Hands-on Projects**
1. **Basic Monorepo with Nx** - Create a simple monorepo with multiple projects.
2. **Full-Stack Monorepo** - A Next.js frontend + NestJS backend in a single repo.
3. **Monorepo for Libraries** - Managing shared UI components with React and Storybook.
4. **CI/CD Monorepo Pipeline** - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment.

I'll start by creating a document for the course and include hands-on project guides. Would you like me to use **Nx** as the primary tool, or do you prefer another (e.g., Turborepo, Lerna, Bazel)?
